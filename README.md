## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal webpage! The purpose of this project is to create a simple web application to showcase my skills, projects, and interests, as well as to learn more about web development. This app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Vue.js framework and Bootstrap for styling.
